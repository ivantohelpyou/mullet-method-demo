---

## 🚀 Setup & Reset

```bash
# Reset to clean state (run before each demo)
./reset_demo.sh

# Start the demo
./start_demo.sh
```

## ⚡ Quick Demo Workflow

**Correct order for live demo:**

1. **Reset & Start**: `./reset_demo.sh && ./start_demo.sh`
2. **Create Restaurant Theme**: `./add_template.py corporate restaurant restaurant`
3. **Add Restaurant Site**: `./add_new_site.py` or `./add_restaurant.py "Name" "Description"`
4. **Visit**: http://localhost:5000/restaurant (shows proper restaurant content, not "Industry Leader"!)
5. **Live Content Management**:
   - `./add_contact_block.py corporate home` → refresh corporate site
   - `./add_content_block.py blog home list "Features" "Fast\nSEO optimized\nMobile responsive"`
   - `./add_content_block.py portfolio home quote "" "Design is how it works - Steve Jobs"`
6. **Show Database**: `./show_database_sites.py`

## 📱 Demo Sites

Once running, visit these URLs:

- **Corporate Site**: http://localhost:5000/corporate
- **Tech Blog**: http://localhost:5000/blog
- **Portfolio**: http://localhost:5000/portfolio

## 🎭 Part 1: The Problem

### **Show Traditional Flask Code**

1. Open `traditional_flask_example.py` in your editor
2. Highlight the problems:
   ```python
   # ❌ HARDCODED ROUTES - Every site needs code changes
   @app.route('/corporate/home')
   def corporate_home():
       return render_template('corporate/home.html')

   @app.route('/corporate/about')
   def corporate_about():
       return render_template('corporate/about.html')

   # ... 15+ more route functions for just 3 sites!
   ```

3. **Key Problems to Emphasize:**
   - ❌ Every new site = CODE CHANGES + DEPLOYMENT
   - ❌ Every new page = CODE CHANGES + DEPLOYMENT
   - ❌ Can't add sites dynamically
   - ❌ No content management without developers
   - ❌ Hard to maintain as sites grow
   - ❌ No way for AI agents to add new sites/pages

---

## 🎯 Part 2: The Solution

### **Show the Mullet Method**

1. Open `app.py` and show the magic:
   ```python
   @app.route('/<path:url_path>')
   def dynamic_route(url_path):
       # ✅ ONE route handles ALL sites through database lookups
       site = resolve_site(site_prefix)      # Database lookup
       page = resolve_page(site, page_path)  # Database lookup
       return render_template(template, site=site, page=page)
   ```

2. **Key Benefits:**
   - ✅ ONE route handles unlimited sites
   - ✅ Add new sites through database only
   - ✅ No code changes needed
   - ✅ Perfect for AI agents
   - ✅ Content management through database

### **Live Demo of Existing Sites**

1. Visit each site and show they're completely different:
   - **Corporate**: http://localhost:5000/corporate
   - **Blog**: http://localhost:5000/blog
   - **Portfolio**: http://localhost:5000/portfolio

2. **Point out:**
   - Different themes and layouts
   - Different navigation menus
   - Different content types
   - All served by the SAME Flask app
   - All resolved through database lookups

---

## 🎬 Part 3: Live Demo - Add New Site

### **Option A: Pre-built Restaurant Site**

1. **While the app is still running**, open a new terminal
2. **First, create the restaurant theme** (only needed once):
   ```bash
   ./add_template.py corporate restaurant restaurant
   ```
3. **Then add the restaurant site**:
   ```bash
   ./add_new_site.py
   ```

4. **Show the template creation output:**
   ```
   🍽️  Creating restaurant theme from corporate theme
      (Customizing content for restaurant industry)
   ✅ Restaurant theme created successfully!
   🍽️  Restaurant-specific customizations:
      - Fresh Ingredients (instead of Industry Leader)
      - Expert Chefs (instead of Expert Team)
      - Family Atmosphere (instead of 24/7 Support)
   ```

5. **Show the site creation output:**
   ```
   🍕 Adding new restaurant site dynamically...
      (No code changes required!)
   ✅ Restaurant site added successfully!
   🌐 New site available at: http://localhost:5000/restaurant
   ```

### **Option B: Custom Restaurant Site (More Impressive!)**

1. **While the app is still running**, create a custom restaurant:
   ```bash
   ./add_restaurant.py "Mario's Pizzeria" "Authentic New York style pizza since 1952"
   ```

2. **Show the dynamic output:**
   ```
   🍽️  Adding new restaurant site: Mario's Pizzeria
      Path: /marios-pizzeria
      Description: Authentic New York style pizza since 1952
      (No code changes required!)

   ✅ Restaurant site added successfully!
   🌐 New site available at: http://localhost:5000/marios-pizzeria
   ```

3. **Try another one for extra impact:**
   ```bash
   ./add_restaurant.py "Sakura Sushi & Ramen" "Traditional Japanese cuisine with fresh sashimi"
   ```

4. **Visit the new sites immediately:**
   - http://localhost:5000/marios-pizzeria
   - http://localhost:5000/sakura-sushi-ramen
   - Show how each has custom content based on the name/description

### **🎯 BONUS: Live Content Management**

**Show real-time content updates while the app is running:**

1. **Add a contact form to the corporate site:**
   ```bash
   ./add_contact_block.py corporate home
   ```
   - **Refresh** http://localhost:5000/corporate/home
   - **Show** the contact form appeared instantly!

2. **Add dynamic content to the blog:**
   ```bash
   ./add_content_block.py blog home list "Key Features" "Lightning fast performance\nSEO optimized content\nMobile-first responsive design\nAccessible to all users"
   ```
   - **Refresh** http://localhost:5000/blog/home
   - **Show** the feature list appeared instantly!

3. **Add an inspirational quote to portfolio:**
   ```bash
   ./add_content_block.py portfolio home quote "" "Design is not just what it looks like - design is how it works. - Steve Jobs"
   ```
   - **Refresh** http://localhost:5000/portfolio/home
   - **Show** the quote appeared instantly!

**Key Points:**
- ✅ **NO APP RESTART** needed
- ✅ **INSTANT UPDATES** - refresh page to see changes
- ✅ **UNLIMITED CONTENT TYPES** - text, lists, quotes, HTML, etc.
- ✅ **PERFECT FOR CMS** - content managers can update without developers

5. **Emphasize the key points:**
   - ✅ **NO CODE CHANGES** were made to the main app
   - ✅ **NO RESTART** required
   - ✅ **INSTANT AVAILABILITY** - sites work immediately
   - ✅ **CUSTOM CONTENT** - each site uses the provided name/description
   - ✅ **UNLIMITED SCALABILITY** - add as many sites as you want
   - ✅ **PERFECT FOR AI AGENTS** - they can create sites programmatically

### **Show the Database Changes**

Optional: Show all sites now in the database:
```bash
# Show all sites in the database
./show_database_sites.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
🗄️  Database-Driven Sites:
==================================================

🌐 Acme Corporation
   Path: /corporate
   Theme: corporate

🌐 Tech Insights Blog
   Path: /blog
   Theme: blog

🌐 Creative Portfolio
   Path: /portfolio
   Theme: portfolio

🌐 Mario's Pizzeria
   Path: /marios-pizzeria
   Theme: corporate

🌐 Sakura Sushi & Ramen
   Path: /sakura-sushi-ramen
   Theme: corporate

==================================================
✅ Total: 5 sites, all served by ONE Flask route!
🎯 Key Point: Adding new sites = database changes only
```

## 🛠️ Technical Commands

### **Site Management**
```bash
# Reset database only
./seed_data.py

# Create restaurant theme (do this BEFORE adding restaurants)
./add_template.py corporate restaurant restaurant

# Add pre-built restaurant site
./add_new_site.py

# Add custom restaurant site
./add_restaurant.py "Restaurant Name" "Description"

# Show all sites in database
./show_database_sites.py
```

### **Content Management (NEW!)**
```bash
# Add contact form to any page
./add_contact_block.py corporate home
./add_contact_block.py portfolio contact

# Add any content block type
./add_content_block.py <site> <page> <type> <title> <content>

# Examples:
./add_content_block.py blog home list "Features" "Fast loading\\nSEO optimized\\nMobile responsive"
./add_content_block.py corporate about text "Mission" "We deliver excellence"
./add_content_block.py portfolio home quote "" "Design is how it works - Steve Jobs"
```

### **Application Control**
```bash
# Start app manually
.venv/bin/python app.py

# Check what's installed
.venv/bin/pip list
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Flask not found**: Use `.venv/bin/python` instead of `python`
- **Database issues**: Run `./reset_demo.sh` to recreate
- **Port in use**: Change port in `app.py` or kill existing process
- **Restaurant site exists**: Reset demo first with `./reset_demo.sh`
- **add_restaurant.py usage**: `python add_restaurant.py "Name" "Description"`
- **Site path conflicts**: Restaurant names are auto-converted to URL-safe paths
